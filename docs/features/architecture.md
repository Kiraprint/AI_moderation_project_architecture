# System Architecture

This document outlines the high-level architecture of the AI Moderation Project.

## Overview

The system is built using a microservices architecture, with the following main components:

- API Gateway
- Content Processing Service
- AI Model Service
- Database Service
- Monitoring Service

## Component Details

### API Gateway

The API Gateway serves as the entry point for all client requests. It handles:

- Request routing
- Authentication
- Rate limiting
- Request/response transformation

### Content Processing Service

This service is responsible for:

- Content ingestion
- Pre-processing
- Queue management
- Result aggregation

### AI Model Service

The AI Model Service:

- Hosts the ML models
- Performs inference
- Manages model versions
- Handles model updates

### Database Service

The database layer:

- Stores moderation results
- Maintains audit logs
- Caches frequently accessed data
- Manages user configurations

## Data Flow

1. Client sends content to API Gateway
2. Gateway authenticates and routes request
3. Content Processing Service pre-processes the content
4. AI Model Service performs moderation
5. Results are stored in Database Service
6. Response is returned to client

## Deployment Architecture

The system can be deployed in various configurations:

- Single-server deployment
- Multi-server deployment
- Kubernetes cluster
- Cloud-native deployment

## Security Considerations

- All services communicate over TLS
- API Gateway implements OAuth2
- Database encryption at rest
- Regular security audits
- Rate limiting and DDoS protection

## Monitoring and Logging

The system includes:

- Centralized logging
- Performance metrics
- Error tracking
- Usage analytics
- Health checks

## Scaling Considerations

The system is designed to scale:

- Horizontally for increased load
- Vertically for resource-intensive operations
- Automatically based on demand
- Across multiple regions
